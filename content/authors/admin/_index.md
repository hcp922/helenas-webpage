Currently interning at Micron Technology. I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Computer Systems Lab (CSL) at Cornell University, under the supervision of Professor José Martínez. I am interested in designing new architectures that blend the memory and processing units. I am currently part of the Center for Research in Intelligent Storage and Processing in Memory (CRISP) and Center on Durable, Energy-Efficient, Pausable Processing in Polymorphic Memories (DEEP3M).
