abstract: Since the early 70s, simulation infrastructures have been a keystone in computer architecture research, providing a fast and reliable way to prototype and evaluate ideas for future computing systems. There are different types of simulators, from most detailed (cycle-accurate) to time-based functional and analytical modeling. Increasing accuracy translates into several orders of magnitude in terms of simulation speed. Yet, a question remains open: are the results derived from the simulation infrastructure representative of a real machine?
